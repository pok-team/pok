## 1. 调度算法

#### 1. 多线程调度

在pok中，每个线程被唤醒时会额外占一个时间片（上下文切换占用的时间），该时间片不在time_capacity中。在我们的实验环境中，规定每个时间片为20个time unit。

我们的测试在examples/semaphores基础上进行了修改。在以下的多线程调度场景中，设置分区数为1，使用单处理器（Processor 0）进行调度。

```c
#define POK_CONFIG_NB_PARTITIONS 1
#define POK_CONFIG_NB_PROCESSORS 1
```

运行结果会在qemu窗口打印，具体的打印逻辑在调度函数中。如下为抢占式优先级测试打印的部分结果

```
P0T1: Start scheduling (priority: 60) at 20
P0T1: Remaining time:40 (priority: 60) at 40
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (priority: 60) at 60
```

以第一行为例，其中P0T0表示0号处理器的线程1，60为当前线程的优先级。20表示当前时间点。

"Start scheduling"表示线程被唤醒。

"Remaining time"记录当前线程的剩余时间数。

##### 1.1 抢占式优先级调度

创建如下三个线程：

```c
 //T1
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 60;
  tattr.priority = 60;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T2
  tattr.period = 400;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  tattr.priority = 50;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T3
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  tattr.priority = 40;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

我们期望的结果是优先级（priority）大的线程优先运行。T1会应该先执行3个时间片，而后T2执行5个时间片，T3执行7个时间片。在第20个时间片（即Time at 400）时，T2被再次唤醒，然后执行4个时间片，直到time at 500时T1再次被唤醒并抢占执行。

```tex
P0T1: Start scheduling (priority: 60) at 20
P0T1: Remaining time:40 (priority: 60) at 40
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (priority: 60) at 60
P0T1: Finished (priority: 60) at 80
P0T2: Start scheduling (priority: 50) at 80
P0T2: Remaining time:80 (priority: 50) at 100
P0T2: Remaining time:60 (priority: 50) at 120
P0T2: Remaining time:40 (priority: 50) at 140
P0T2: Remaining time:20 (priority: 50) at 160
P0T2: Finished (priority: 50) at 180
P0T3: Start scheduling (priority: 40) at 180
P0T3: Remaining time:120 (priority: 40) at 200
P0T3: Remaining time:100 (priority: 40) at 220
P0T3: Remaining time:80 (priority: 40) at 240
P0T3: Remaining time:60 (priority: 40) at 260
P0T3: Remaining time:40 (priority: 40) at 280
P0T3: Remaining time:20 (priority: 40) at 300
P0T3: Finished (priority: 40) at 320
Idle at 320.
...
P0T2: Start scheduling (priority: 50) at 400
P0T2: Remaining time:80 (priority: 50) at 420
P0T2: Remaining time:60 (priority: 50) at 440
P0T2: Remaining time:40 (priority: 50) at 460
P0T2: Remaining time:20 (priority: 50) at 480
P0T2: Finished (priority: 50) at 500
P0T1: Start scheduling (priority: 60) at 500
P0T1: Remaining time:40 (priority: 60) at 520
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (priority: 60) at 540
```

结果符合预期。

##### 1.2 抢占式EDF

创建如下三个线程,deadline表示线程的相对ddl：

```c
 //T1
  tattr.period = 200;
  tattr.deadline = 120;
  tattr.time_capacity = 60;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T2
  tattr.period = 400;
  tattr.deadline = 400;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T3
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.deadline = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

按照EDF策略，T1的deadline最早，应该T1先被唤醒，然后运行3个时间片，然后T2被唤醒，运行5个时间片。在时间为200时，由于T1的绝对ddl为320，提前于T2和T3的ddl，因此调度T1。而后调度T2,T3。运行后产生的结果如下：

```
P0T1: Start scheduling (deadline: 120) at 20
P0T1: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 120) at 40
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 120) at 60
P0T1: Finished (deadline: 120) at 80
P0T3: Start scheduling (deadline: 400) at 80
P0T3: Remaining time:120 (deadline: 400) at 100
P0T3: Remaining time:100 (deadline: 400) at 120
P0T3: Remaining time:80 (deadline: 400) at 140
P0T3: Remaining time:60 (deadline: 400) at 160
P0T3: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 400) at 180
P0T1: Start scheduling (deadline: 320) at 200
P0T1: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 320) at 220
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 320) at 240
P0T1: Finished (deadline: 320) at 260
P0T3: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 400) at 260
P0T3: Finished (deadline: 400) at 280
P0T2: Start scheduling (deadline: 500) at 280
P0T2: Remaining time:80 (deadline: 500) at 300
P0T2: Remaining time:60 (deadline: 500) at 320
P0T2: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 500) at 340
P0T2: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 500) at 360
P0T2: Finished (deadline: 500) at 380
Idle at 380.
P0T1: Start scheduling (deadline: 520) at 400
P0T1: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 520) at 420
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 520) at 440
P0T1: Finished (deadline: 520) at 460
P0T3: Start scheduling (deadline: 800) at 460
P0T3: Remaining time:120 (deadline: 800) at 480
P0T3: Remaining time:100 (deadline: 800) at 500
P0T3: Remaining time:80 (deadline: 800) at 520
P0T3: Remaining time:60 (deadline: 800) at 540
P0T3: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 800) at 560
P0T3: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 800) at 580
P0T3: Finished (deadline: 800) at 600
P0T1: Start scheduling (deadline: 720) at 600
```

结果符合预期。

##### 1.3 Round-Robin

创建如下三个线程，采用默认参数：每个线程每个round最多运行3个时间片。

```c
//T1
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 60;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T2
  tattr.period = 400;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T3
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

按照Round-Robin策略，T1，T2，T3一次运行三个时间片，而后T1运行完本周期内最后一个时间片后再把控制权交给T2，T2运行完三个时间片后，控制权交给T3，直到被再次唤醒。

```
P0T1: Start scheduling at 20
P0T1: Remaining time:40 at 40
P0T1: Remaining time:20 at 60
P0T1: Finished (deadline: 120) at 80
P0T2: Start scheduling at 80
P0T2: Remaining time:80 at 100
P0T2: Remaining time:60 at 120
P0T3: Start scheduling at 140
P0T3: Remaining time:120 at 160
P0T3: Remaining time:100 at 180
P0T2: Remaining time:40 at 200
P0T2: Remaining time:20 at 220
P0T2: Finished (deadline: 400) at 240
P0T3: Remaining time:80 at 240
P0T3: Remaining time:60 at 260
P0T3: Remaining time:40 at 280
P0T3: Remaining time:20 at 300
P0T3: Finished (deadline: 500) at 320
Idle at 320.
...
```

结果符合预期。

##### 1.4 Weighted-Round-Robin

创建如下三个线程，权重分别为1，2，3。在kernel/deployment.h中设置权值为1的线程每个round能被运行的最大时间片为2。

```c
//T1
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 60;
  tattr.weight = 1;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T2
  tattr.period = 400;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  tattr.weight = 2;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
//T3
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  tattr.weight = 3;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

根据每个线程的weight值，三个线程每轮能运行的最大时间片数应分别为2，4，6。运行对应测试，结果如下：

```
P0T1: Start scheduling at 20
P0T1: Remaining time:40 at 40
P0T2: Start scheduling at 60
P0T2: Remaining time:80 at 80
P0T2: Remaining time:60 at 100
P0T2: Remaining time:40 at 120
P0T3: Start scheduling at 140
P0T3: Remaining time:120 at 160
P0T3: Remaining time:100 at 180
P0T3: Remaining time:80 at 200
P0T3: Remaining time:60 at 220
P0T3: Remaining time:40 at 240
P0T1: Remaining time:20 at 260
P0T1: Finished (deadline: 120) at 280
P0T2: Remaining time:20 at 280
P0T2: Finished (deadline: 400) at 300
P0T3: Remaining time:20 at 300
P0T3: Finished (deadline: 500) at 320
Idle at 320.
Idle at 340.
Idle at 360.
Idle at 380.
P0T2: Start scheduling at 400
P0T2: Remaining time:80 at 420
P0T2: Remaining time:60 at 440
P0T2: Remaining time:40 at 460
P0T2: Remaining time:20 at 480
P0T2: Finished (deadline: 800) at 500
P0T3: Start scheduling at 500
P0T3: Remaining time:120 at 520
```

结果符合预期

#### 2.多分区调度

设置分区为2，在两个分区上分别创建两个线程（P0T1,P0T2在分区1上，P0T4,P0T5在分区2上）

```c
//分区1线程：
  tattr.period = 500;
  tattr.deadline = 120;
  tattr.time_capacity = 60;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);

  tattr.period = tattr.deadline = 400;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

```c
//分区2线程：
  tattr.period = tattr.deadline = 400;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  tattr.priority = 50;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);

  tattr.period = tattr.deadline = 500;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  tattr.priority = 40;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

在分区1上应用EDF调度算法，在分区2上应用优先级调度算法，每200个时间单位切换一次分区。

```c
#define POK_CONFIG_PARTITIONS_NTHREADS                                 
  { 3, 3 }
#define POK_CONFIG_PARTITIONS_SCHEDULER                                 
  { POK_MY_SCHED_EDF, POK_MY_SCHED_PRIO }
#define POK_CONFIG_PROGRAM_NAME                                                \
  { "pr1/pr1.elf", "pr2/pr2.elf" }
#define POK_CONFIG_SCHEDULING_MAJOR_FRAME 800
#define POK_CONFIG_SCHEDULING_NBSLOTS 4
#define POK_CONFIG_SCHEDULING_SLOTS                                            \
  { 200, 200, 200, 200 }
```

运行结果如下图。在时间点为200时，在分区2上的P0T4线程和P0T5线程开始被调度，同时调度算法切换为优先级算法。

```

P0T2: Finished (deadline: 400) at 180
Idle at 180.

P0T2: Remaining time:80 (deadline: 800) at 420
P0T2: Remaining time:60 (deadline: 800) at 440
P0T2: Remaining time:40 (deadline: 800) at 460
P0T2: Remaining time:20 (deadline: 800) at 480
P0T2: Finished (deadline: 800) at 500
P0T1: Start scheduling (deadline: 620) at 500
```

结果符合预期

## 2. 动态增加线程
&emsp;&emsp;在测试的程序中，我们设计了一个获取用户输入并动态创建线程的逻辑，用户输入1、2、3来创建三种不同参数的线程。
```c
static void init_thread() {
  char buf[512];
  for (;;) {
      int buf_idx = 0;
      printf("$ ");
      for (;;) {
          int ch = getch();
          if (ch == '\r' || ch == '\n') {
              printf("\r\n");
              buf[buf_idx] = '\0';
              break;
          } else {
              putch(ch);
              buf[buf_idx++] = (char)ch;
          }
      }
      if (buf_idx == 0) {
          continue;
      }

      if (strcmp("1", buf) == 0) {
          create_task(1000, 100);
      } else if (strcmp("2", buf) == 0) {
          create_task(800, 400);
      } else if (strcmp("3", buf) == 0) {
          create_task(600, 200);
      } else if (strcmp("top", buf) == 0) {
          pok_top();
      } else if (strcmp("help", buf) == 0 || strcmp("h", buf) == 0) {
          printf("Please press 1,2 and 3 to create different tasks,\npress top to show threads,\nand press quit/q to quit.\n");
      }
      
      if (strcmp("quit", buf) == 0 || strcmp("q", buf) == 0) {
          break;
      }
  }

  printf("Please press ctrl+a and x to quit QEMU.\n");
  pok_thread_wait_infinite();
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;以下是运行结果，其中Thread 21是IDLE Thread。

```

```

&emsp;&emsp;我们在`depolyment.h`中规定`POK_CONFIG_PARTITIONS_NTHREADS`为20，最多只能创建20个线程，在需要创建更多线程的场景下调整该参数即可。

## 4.相互依赖的多任务并行应用场景

我们构建如下四个周期性任务，依次模拟控制，监控，评估和通知任务。其中，考虑到实际场景，控制任务优先级最高，对实时性要求也最高，不能被miss。监控作为可历史回放的依据，优先级其次，其余两个任务偏向软实时，实时性要求次之（可以ddl miss一小段时间）。同一周期内，评估任务只有在监控任务执行完成后才能执行

```c
  //控制任务
  tattr.period = 200;
  tattr.priority = 30;
  tattr.deadline = 120;
  tattr.time_capacity = 60;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);

  //监控任务
  tattr.period = tattr.deadline = 500;
  tattr.priority = 20;
  tattr.time_capacity = 100;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);

  //评估任务
  tattr.period = tattr.deadline = 400;
  tattr.priority = 10;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);

  //通知任务
  tattr.period = tattr.deadline = 400;
  tattr.priority = 10;
  tattr.time_capacity = 140;
  ret = pok_thread_create(&tid, &tattr);
```

我们使用现有的优先级算法、EDF算法和Round-Robin分别对上述任务设计进行了测试，得到结果如下。我们发现三个经典算法都对于该任务不能很好地适应，而我们的基于优先级的EDF算法能够较好的适应该场景。

#### 1. 优先级算法

测试的具体结果如下。我们发现，尽管前三个任务都没有miss的情况，但通知任务miss了很久。在前660个时间单位内，通知任务只获得了三个时间片，会出现miss deadline时间较长的情况，公平性较差。

```

P0T1: Remaining time:40 (priority: 30) at 620
P0T1: Remaining time:20 (priority: 30) at 640
P0T1: Finished (priority: 30) at 660
P0T3: Start scheduling (priority: 10) at 660
```

#### 2. EDF算法

具体测试结果如下。在前660个时间单位内，实时性要求最高的控制任务miss了两次，这对于硬实时任务来说是非常严重的问题。而评估任务也miss了一次，产生了120个时间单位的严重延时，可见EDF对于该场景的适应性较差。

#### 3. Round-Robin算法

测试结果如下。Round-Robin算法更注重公平性，而忽略了任务间的重要程度差别。在前640个时间单位，需要执行时间较长的评估任务和通知任务分别miss了160个时间单位和240个时间单位，延时较长。

#### 4. 基于优先级的EDF算法

测试结果如下。在前1000个时间单位内，仅最不重要的通知任务被miss了一次，实时性要求最高的1能得到及时的执行，且具有依赖关系的监控任务和评估任务也能被很好的平衡调度，因此我们认为设计的算法在该场景中优于现有算法。
